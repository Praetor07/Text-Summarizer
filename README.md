# Text-Summarizer

Initially the stopwords and punctuation marks are removed. The text is split on ('.') and is processed on a per/sentences basis.
The weight associated with each word is in direct proportion with its number of occurrences.
The weights are then normalised and each sentences' weight is calculated.
Sort them in the order of their weights and display the sentences with the highest weights.
